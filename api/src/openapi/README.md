## Whats the difference between [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) and [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/)?

OpenAPI and JSON-SChema are identical in many ways, but in general:

### OpenAPI

OpenAPI is designed to define an entire API

- server urls
- server meta information
- routes/paths
- requests
- responses
- etc

### JSON-Schema

JSON-Schema is designed to define a JSON object

- any use case where an object must conform to a known template.
